/// every line is opened, written, and closed.  At the volumes we log
/// (handful of lines per second at peak) the overhead is irrelevant, and
/// in exchange we get hard guarantees:
///   - no `IOSink` "bound to a stream" races between flush and write
///   - every line on disk before the next instruction runs
///   - safe to call from any zone, including PlatformDispatcher.onError
///
/// A previous IOSink-based implementation looped because flush errors
/// bubbled into the global error handler, which then tried to log the
/// error, which re-entered this output.
