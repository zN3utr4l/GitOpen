# GitOpen — Design Spec

- **Date:** 2026-05-08
- **Status:** Draft, pending user review
- **Author:** s.porta (with Claude Opus 4.7)

## 1. Summary

GitOpen is a cross-platform open-source desktop Git client inspired by Fork.
Targets Windows and Ubuntu. Single user, single workstation; no cloud
component. Designed for users who work with many repositories simultaneously
and rely heavily on the commit graph (tree view) to navigate repository state.

The MVP scope is "quasi-Fork": full visualisation plus the daily-use write
operations (commit, push/pull/fetch, checkout/create branch, stash,
merge/rebase/cherry-pick, conflict detection with external editor).

Development is AI-assisted (Claude / Copilot driven). The stack choice
optimises for: single language end-to-end, strong AI training corpus,
true cross-platform support including Linux.

## 2. Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Runtime | .NET 8 (or current LTS at implementation time) |
| Desktop host | **Photino.Blazor** — system webview wrapper for .NET |
| UI | Blazor (C# + HTML/CSS) |
| Git read operations | **LibGit2Sharp** |
| Git write operations | **git CLI** (shell-out) |
| Persistence | **SQLite** via **Entity Framework Core** |
| Logging | **Serilog** (file + in-memory sinks) |
| Tests | xUnit, bUnit (Blazor components), FluentAssertions |
| CI | GitHub Actions matrix (windows-latest, ubuntu-latest) |
| Packaging | MSIX (Windows), AppImage (Linux) |
| License | MIT |

Rationale: Photino.Blazor delivers an Electron-style web UI experience while
keeping the application a single .NET process. Bundle size is ~50–80 MB
versus Electron's 150+ MB. True Linux support, unlike .NET MAUI (which has no
official Linux backend). Single-language stack (C#) reduces context-switching
cost for AI-assisted development.

## 3. Solution Structure

```
GitOpen.sln
├─ src/
│  ├─ GitOpen.Domain/           POCOs: Repo, Commit, Branch, Ref, ...
│  ├─ GitOpen.Application/      Use cases, services, DTOs, contracts
│  ├─ GitOpen.Infrastructure/   LibGit2Sharp, git CLI, SQLite, FS watcher
│  └─ GitOpen.Ui/               Photino host + Blazor components
├─ tests/
│  ├─ GitOpen.Domain.Tests/
│  ├─ GitOpen.Application.Tests/
│  ├─ GitOpen.Infrastructure.Tests/   Tests against real temp git repos
│  └─ GitOpen.Ui.Tests/                bUnit component tests
├─ docs/
│  └─ superpowers/specs/
└─ .github/workflows/             CI matrix Win + Ubuntu
```

Dependency direction is strict: Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure, Ui.
Domain has no external dependencies.

## 4. Git Operations: Hybrid LibGit2Sharp + git CLI

A single `IGitOperations` façade routes calls to two concrete
implementations:

### 4.1 LibGit2Sharp (read path)
- Commit log / graph traversal
- Diff, blame, show
- Status (working tree + index)
- Branches, tags, refs enumeration
- Object database lookups

Reasoning: 10–100× faster than parsing `git log` output for large histories.
Direct in-process access avoids process-spawn overhead during continuous
refresh of the commit list.

### 4.2 git CLI (write path)
- Push / pull / fetch (uses user's credential helper, SSH config, proxy)
- Commit (executes user's pre-commit / commit-msg hooks)
- Merge, rebase (including interactive), cherry-pick
- Stash operations
- Submodules, LFS
- Reset, restore, checkout when modifying state

Reasoning: complete behavioural parity with the user's existing git
configuration; support for hooks and credential management without
re-implementation.

### 4.3 External dependency
On first run, application probes for `git --version`. If absent, displays an
onboarding dialog with platform-specific install instructions
(Git for Windows on Windows; `apt install git` on Ubuntu).

### 4.4 Filesystem watcher
A debounced `FileSystemWatcher` (200 ms debounce) is attached to each open
repo's `.git/` directory and its `refs/` and `HEAD`. External changes
(commits from terminal, fetch from CI script) trigger an incremental refresh
of status and refs.

## 5. Multi-Repo and Multi-Window UX

### 5.1 Conceptual model
- `Workspace` = one open repository with its own state (selected branch,
  commit, scroll, filters, file watcher, cancellation tokens).
- `WorkspaceManager` is a process-wide singleton owning the workspace list.
- `Window` is a Photino `PhotinoWindow` instance hosting a Blazor circuit.
  A window owns a subset of workspaces (its visible tabs).

### 5.2 Default behaviour
- Single window with horizontal tab bar (one tab per workspace).
- Drag a tab outside the window → spawns a new `PhotinoWindow` with that
  workspace; the workspace migrates from old window to new.
- Window position, size, and assigned workspaces persist in SQLite.

### 5.3 Layout (per window)
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TabBar [repo A] [repo B*] [repo C]   [+] [⚙]    │  * unread fetch badge
├────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Side-  │  Toolbar: Fetch Pull Push Stash Branch  │
│ bar:   ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Local  │  Commit graph (virtualized list, SVG)   │
│ Remote │                                         │
│ Tags   ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Stash  │  Tabs: Commit | Changes | File Tree     │
│        │  Diff viewer                            │
└────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5.4 Repo discovery
- Drag-and-drop a folder onto the window
- File → Open Repository (Photino native folder picker)
- Recent list (max 20, persisted)
- File → Scan Folder: recursive scan to bulk-import repos

### 5.5 Background fetch
- "Fetch All" command across all open workspaces
- Max 4 concurrent fetches; remainder queued
- Per-tab badge when new commits arrive that user has not yet viewed
- Non-blocking toast on completion (configurable; on by default)

### 5.6 Concurrency rules
- Operations on different repos: fully parallel
- Read operations on the same repo: parallel
- Write operations on the same repo: serialised through a per-workspace
  operation queue
- All long operations accept a `CancellationToken`; the UI exposes a Cancel
  control

## 6. Commit Graph Rendering

The commit graph is the application's hot loop and the primary perf concern.

### 6.1 Layout calculation (background, C#)
- On repo open, stream commits topologically via LibGit2Sharp
- Compute per-commit `lane index` and parent edges using a standard
  lane-assignment algorithm (variant of the gitk algorithm)
- Result: an immutable list of `CommitNode { Sha, Lane, Parents[], Color, Refs[] }`
- Cache the result in SQLite (`commit_graph_cache` table) keyed by sha;
  re-used on next open

### 6.2 Rendering (Blazor)
- Blazor's built-in `<Virtualize>` component renders only visible rows
  (~50 rows at a time, ~24 px each)
- Per-row inline **SVG** draws the graph segment for that row
  (lane circles + edges to neighbouring rows)
- SVG chosen over global Canvas: GPU-accelerated by browser, native hit-test,
  simpler accessibility, simpler component model. Trade-off: more DOM nodes;
  acceptable up to ~100k commits, may need Canvas rewrite at 1M+

### 6.3 Incremental updates
- On fetch / commit, recompute only the delta and prepend
- Filewatcher on `.git/refs` and `.git/HEAD` triggers refresh
- Throttle render notifications to 100 ms when bulk events arrive

### 6.4 Search and filter
- Search box matches sha (prefix), commit message (substring, case-insensitive),
  author name/email
- Implemented as in-memory filter; instant up to ~500k commits
- Beyond 500k: SQLite FTS5 index (deferred to v0.2)

### 6.5 Refs overlay
Branches and tags rendered as coloured pill labels on the row of their target
commit. Click for context menu (checkout, delete, rename, etc.).

### 6.6 Performance target
60 fps scroll on a 100k-commit repository on a mid-range laptop
(Ryzen 5 / 16 GB / SSD).

## 7. State Management and Persistence

### 7.1 State tier
| Tier | Lifetime | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Singleton (DI) | Process | `IWorkspaceManager`, `ISettingsService`, `IGitOperations` |
| Scoped per Workspace | Workspace open | `IWorkspaceState`, `ICommitGraphCache` |
| Component-local | Component | Menu open/closed, hover, transient input |

Components observe service events and call `StateHasChanged()` to refresh.
Bulk events (e.g., 10k commits streamed) are throttled (100 ms) before
triggering renders.

### 7.2 Persistence
- SQLite database in OS-appropriate config location:
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%/GitOpen/state.db`
  - Linux: `~/.config/GitOpen/state.db`
- Schema managed by **Entity Framework Core Migrations**
- Tables:
  - `repositories` (id, path, alias, color, last_opened, tab_order)
  - `repository_state` (repo_id, last_branch, last_commit_sha, scroll_offset)
  - `windows` (id, x, y, w, h, workspace_ids JSON)
  - `commit_graph_cache` (repo_id, sha, lane, parent_shas JSON, color)
  - `recent_commits_seen` (repo_id, sha, seen_at) for unread badges
  - `activity_log` (id, ts, repo_id, op, ok, stdout, stderr) capped at 200
  - `settings` (key, value_json)

### 7.3 User settings file
A separate human-readable `settings.json` for theme, fonts, default sizes,
and customised keybindings. Lives next to `state.db`. Out-of-band edits by the
user are detected on save and merged.

### 7.4 Credentials
GitOpen does not store credentials. All authentication is delegated to git's
credential helper (Git Credential Manager on Windows; libsecret/keyring on
Linux).

### 7.5 Cross-window state sync
Singletons are process-wide; events from `WorkspaceManager` are received by
every Blazor host in every window. No IPC needed.

## 8. Error Handling

### 8.1 Result types vs exceptions
Expected git failures (network, auth, conflict, non-fast-forward, dirty
working tree) return a `GitResult` value:

```csharp
public sealed record GitResult(
    bool Ok,
    GitErrorKind Kind,
    string? ErrorMessage,
    string? RawCliOutput,
    object? Payload);
```

Exceptions are reserved for programmer errors (NRE, invariant violation).

### 8.2 User feedback channels
| Severity | UX |
|---|---|
| Success (operation completed) | 2-second green toast (bottom-right), opt-in/out |
| Non-blocking error (e.g. 1 fetch of 5 failed) | Persistent red toast with "Show details" |
| Blocking error (conflict, auth required) | Modal with instructions and CTA |

### 8.3 Activity panel
A slide-in panel (bottom-right) listing recent operations: timestamp, repo,
operation, result, and (on expand) the exact command and stdout/stderr.
Last 200 entries persisted in `activity_log`.

### 8.4 Cancellation
All long operations accept `CancellationToken`. UI Cancel button always
available during long ops. Cancellation propagates to `Process.Kill()` for
the git CLI and to LibGit2Sharp's interruption callbacks.

### 8.5 Conflicts (MVP)
- Detect conflict state and list affected files
- Open the user's configured external editor / merge tool (default: $EDITOR
  or VS Code if available) for each conflict
- Provide "Mark as resolved" + "Continue merge/rebase" UI
- A built-in 3-way merge UI is **deferred to v0.2**

### 8.6 Logging
- Serilog with file sink: `logs/gitopen-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, rotated, max 7 days
- In-memory sink feeds the activity panel
- No telemetry, no phone-home — open source default

### 8.7 Crash safety
Top-level handlers (`AppDomain.UnhandledException`,
`TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`) log and show a crash dialog with
"Open log folder" and "Report issue". Persistent state is committed to
SQLite continuously, so a crash never loses workspace setup or user input
state.

## 9. Testing Strategy

### 9.1 Pyramid
| Tier | Count | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| Domain + Application unit tests | ~300 | xUnit + FluentAssertions |
| Infrastructure (vs real git repos) | ~150 | xUnit + `RepoFixture` |
| UI/Integration (Blazor components) | ~50 | bUnit |
| E2E (manual checklist) | ~20 scenarios | `docs/qa-checklist.md` |

### 9.2 RepoFixture pattern
A test fixture creates a temporary git repo in `Path.GetTempPath()`,
seeds it with a known sequence of commits / branches / merges, and exposes
its path to the test. Cleanup on dispose. Avoids fragile mocks; tests
real git behaviour.

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task GetCommits_returns_in_topological_order()
{
    using var repo = await RepoFixture.WithLinearHistory(commits: 10);
    var sut = new LibGit2GitOperations();

    var commits = await sut.GetCommitsAsync(repo.Id, CommitQuery.All, default)
        .ToListAsync();

    commits.Should().HaveCount(10);
    commits[0].Sha.Should().Be(repo.HeadSha);
}
```

### 9.3 Continuous integration
GitHub Actions matrix on `windows-latest` and `ubuntu-latest`:
- `dotnet restore` / `build` / `test`
- Ubuntu runner has git pre-installed; Windows runner does too
- Artefacts (publish output) uploaded for inspection on PRs
- Release workflow on tags `v*.*.*` builds MSIX + AppImage

### 9.4 TDD scope
TDD applied to Application and Infrastructure layers (well-defined edge
cases, complex logic). UI components may be written first then covered by
bUnit tests — UI is exploratory and discovery-driven.

### 9.5 Out of scope
- Photino itself (third-party)
- LibGit2Sharp itself (third-party)
- Pixel-perfect visual regression (manual)

## 10. Packaging and Distribution

### 10.1 Build
`dotnet publish` with platform-specific runtime identifier:
- Windows: `dotnet publish -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true`
- Linux: `dotnet publish -r linux-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true`

`--self-contained` so end users do not need a separate .NET runtime
install. Costs ~80 MB extra in bundle.

### 10.2 Distribution formats (MVP)
| Platform | Format | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | MSIX | `MakeAppx` (Windows SDK) |
| Windows | Portable .zip | manual zip of publish folder |
| Linux | AppImage | `appimagetool` |
| Linux | .deb | `dpkg-deb` |

Flatpak deferred to post-MVP.

### 10.3 Webview dependencies
- Windows: WebView2 runtime (preinstalled on Win 11; auto-installed on
  Win 10 if missing). Bundle a fixed-version copy as fallback.
- Linux: `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0` from apt. Declared as .deb dependency;
  documented as required for the AppImage variant.

### 10.4 Versioning and releases
- Semantic Versioning, git tags `vX.Y.Z`
- GitHub Releases with all artefacts attached
- GitHub Actions matrix release workflow produces all artefacts on tag push

### 10.5 Open-source posture
- License: **MIT**
- Public repository on GitHub
- README, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- Issue templates: bug, feature
- No telemetry by default

### 10.6 Deferred to v0.2+
- Auto-update (Velopack candidate)
- Code signing (Windows EV cert; AppImage GPG signature)
- Built-in 3-way merge UI
- SQLite FTS5 commit search index
- Flatpak distribution

## 11. Out of Scope (Explicit)

- macOS support — possible later (Photino supports it) but not a target
- Hosting integrations (GitHub PRs, GitLab MRs, Bitbucket) — post-MVP
- Mobile clients
- AI features in the product itself (commit message generation, etc.) —
  user clarified development is AI-assisted, product is not AI-featured
- Telemetry, analytics, crash reporting service
- Custom merge tool

## 12. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| WebKitGTK rendering quirks on Linux vs WebView2 on Windows | Visual smoke test on both platforms each release; CSS targets minimum supported browser feature set |
| LibGit2Sharp lags behind upstream libgit2 / git | Hybrid design isolates impact; switch any operation to git CLI if libgit2 misbehaves |
| Commit graph perf at 1M+ commits | SVG-per-row may need rewrite to Canvas; flagged but deferred until users request |
| Multi-window state divergence | Single-process singletons + persistence-on-write keep windows consistent; covered by integration tests |
| Photino.Blazor smaller community | Stack pure C# means most code is portable to Avalonia or MAUI in worst case |
| Quasi-Fork scope is 6+ months | MVP can be staged into vertical slices; first slice is read-only viewer (~4 weeks) |

## 13. Suggested Implementation Phasing

The plan (next document) will detail this; design-level guidance:

1. **Slice 1 — Read-only viewer**: open repos, multi-tab, commit graph, diff,
   branches sidebar. No writes.
2. **Slice 2 — Daily writes**: commit, push/pull/fetch, checkout/create branch.
3. **Slice 3 — Multi-window**: drag-tab-out, window persistence.
4. **Slice 4 — Advanced ops**: merge, rebase, cherry-pick, stash, conflict
   detection with external editor.
5. **Slice 5 — Polish and packaging**: MSIX + AppImage, settings UI,
   keybindings, themes.

Each slice ends in a releasable build.

## 14. Open Questions for Implementation Plan

- Exact .NET version and target framework moniker
- EF Core provider version pinning strategy
- Choice of CSS approach: plain CSS, Tailwind, or component-scoped CSS
- Iconography: Lucide / Heroicons / custom SVG set
- Font: system font stack vs bundled (e.g. Inter, JetBrains Mono for code)
- Keybinding scheme: custom or imitate Fork's

These are tactical and will be settled during planning.
